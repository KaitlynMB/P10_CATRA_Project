# P10_CATRA_Project
 Analysing and processing the features and ratios of catsâ€™ faces to detect pain by utilising the feline grimace scale.

It is an established fact that cats are extremely adept at disguising their pain. Compounding the issue, cats are not always able to effectively communicate their health problems to humans. When they do vocalize in an attempt to gain assistance, humans may find it difficult to understand the cat due to the language barrier between them. This is the biggest reason behind why cat owners are often unable to identify when their cats are unwell or in pain until diseases have progressed to very severe stages, and by then, it may be already too late. 

Furthermore, in Hong Kong, animal shelters are constantly understaffed, especially in the wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This makes it difficult to achieve constant monitoring of all the cats that are in the shelter and creates an opportunity in delaying the identification of sick cats and subsequently, delaying the time they have to receive medical attention. 

As owners of adopted cats, we empathize with both of these problems and would like to ensure the wellbeing of other animals. Previously, we attempted to volunteer in the local animal shelters, but due to age restrictions, we have been prevented from doing so. Hence, we saw this project as an opportunity to create a product that could potentially contribute to mitigating the problems outlined above.

	The solution found to this issue is creating an algorithm that uses the feline grimace scale to detect if a cat is experiencing pain, and judge what level of pain is being felt. Knowledge of the pain levels felt by the cat provide insight into whether the cat potentially has contracted an illness, alerting the user to how likely it is for the cat to be ill and how necessary it is for the cat to seek medical attention from a veterinarian based on the pain level. 

Due to time and knowledge limitations, not all aspects of the project were able to be completed. Details to the challenges of this project will be discussed below.
